The code used for a tutorial for creating TiddlyWeb filters.

For sake of simplicity this plugin keeps its tests within the module
and does not follow the tiddlywebpugins namespace.

To use add put the file in a tiddlyweb instance and then add
'tagscount' to system_plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py:

config = {
    system_plugins: ['tagscount'],
}

Note, however, that this plugin isn't designed for use, it is designed
for demonstration.
